They are a small local business that does not have a lot of time to upkeep their website, leading it to be quite outdated and not optimized for mobile. They are seeking to improve the visibility of their salon through a website redesign with easy user experience in mind. In addition, they are looking to add an online booking feature to their website, so their clients can have full control of setting up their appointments online without the need to make a call.","path":"/goshen#","role":"UI/UX Designer","timeline":"80 hours","skills":"User Research, Interaction Design, UI Design, Wireframing, Prototyping, Usability Testing","projectDescription":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet","projectGoals":"Update the current website to be more modern and appealing to customers, while keeping it responsive, as well as design and add an online booking service.","content":[{"stepTitle":"01 RESEARCH","sections":[{"sectionTitle":"Competitive Analysis","sectionBody_1":"In order to understand the market space, I found various hair salons and did a competitive analysis of their websites. These ranged from big chains to small local hair salons. My goals were to get an idea of any kinds of trends these sites have in common and understand the types of content and features they may share. In regards to content, each website varied quite a bit. Some websites included info about each of their stylists, while others did not. Some sites had online stores or an online booking service. What each of these websites had in common was a section of services and prices and their contact info, which is essential for a site like this.","sectionImageSrc_1":"/images/goshen/goshen-competitive-analysis.png"},{"sectionTitle":"User Interviews","sectionBody_1":"Next, I gathered some users to interview them in order to understand their experiences with hair salon websites. My goals for the interview were to understand what kind of information users need when on theses websites, as well as understand how users are booking their appointments. Additionally, I wanted to see if there was anything frustrating about their experience. I gathered 4 participants between 24-30 years old, and they each frequented a hair salon ranging from once every two weeks to once every couple months.","sectionBody_2":"For booking appointments, only one participant booked through an online service, while others mainly booked through calling or texting. For the participants booking through a call or text, I found that they experienced a lot of frustrations because of how long the booking process took. They said there\'s a lot of back and forth in communication in order to find a time that worked for both of them. Each of them wished that their hair salon provided some kind of online booking service. For the one participant that does use an online booking service, her main frustration was that she had to constantly restart the booking process if she made some kind of mistake. Additionally, there wasn\'t a lot of information about the services in the booking sections which often led to her selecting the wrong one.","sectionBody_3":"Another important thing that I learned was that every participant always goes back to the same hair salon. Once they found a place they liked, they wouldn\'t switch unless they really had to. The main reason they keep returning is because they can develop a rapport with the stylist, so when they return, the stylists already know the history of the hair and how they like it cut. Additionally, I found that the participants never access their hair salon\'s websites outside of the time before their first visit, except for the one participant that books their appointments online. With this info, it is clear that a majority os users accessing the site will be new pontential customers, so it is crucial that the website has all the information they need and attract them enough to get them to book an appointment before they move on to the next hair salon."}]},{"stepTitle":"02 DEFINE","sections":[{"sectionTitle":"Persona","sectionBody_1":"From the data I got from the research phase, I created a persona, Alice Wang, to represent a part of our target users.

For the booking process, many participants expressed frustration with having to deal with a lot of back and forth with the hair salon in order to find an available time. I tried to alleviate those frustrations by listing out the available dates and times and preventing them from selecting an unavailable time.","sectionImageRow":["images/goshen/goshen-wireframe1.png","images/goshen/goshen-wireframe2.png","images/goshen/goshen-wireframe3.png","images/goshen/goshen-wireframe4.png","images/goshen/goshen-wireframe5.png"]},{"sectionTitle":"Branding","twoColumn_1_left":{"body":"With the redesign, I was also tasked with rebranding the site.

While reworking this section, my goals were to make it clear that additional services can be selected, as well as make it clear all the services that have been selected already. I did this by creating an \'Add Another Service\' card after making a selection. After selecting that card it will return to the list of services, and the user may select another service.

Upon clicking the watch party icon, it will bring you to the next screen where you have some options you can set for the watch party. After creating the watch party, you will be prompted with a URL to share with your friends. With a URL, it will be extremely easy for a user to join a watch party as all they have to do is access the URL and they will automatically be placed into the watch party. I chose to keep the chat small and off to the side, so that users can keep it open while watching the stream, and it won\'t take up too much space. Users may also minimize the chat if they find it distracting.

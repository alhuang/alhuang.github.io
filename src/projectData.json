They are a small local business that does not have a lot of time to upkeep their website, leading it to be quite outdated and not optimized for mobile. They are seeking to improve the visibility of their salon through a website redesign with easy user experience in mind. In addition, they are looking to add an online booking feature to their website, so their clients can have full control of setting up their appointments online without the need to make a call.",

Many of the websites varied quite a bit regarding the kind of content and features they have on their site. Some websites included info about each of their stylists, while others did not. Some sites had online stores and had some sort of online booking service. A list of services with prices and contact info are what each of these websites have in common.",

I also wanted to understand how users were booking their hair services and if there were any frustrations with the process. The participants were between 24-30 years old, and they all frequented a hair salon ranging from once every two weeks to once every couple months.",
            "sectionBody_2": "For booking appointments, only one participant booked through an online service, while others mainly booked through calling or texting. For the participants booking through a call or text, I found that they experienced a lot of frustrations because of how long the booking process took. They said there's a lot of back and forth in communication in order to find a time that worked for both of them. Each of them wished that their hair salon provided some kind of online booking service. For the one participant that does use an online booking service, her main frustration was that she had to constantly restart the booking process if she made some kind of mistake. Additionally, there wasn't a lot of information about the services in the booking sections which often led to her selecting the wrong one.",
            "sectionBody_3": "I also found that all the participants typically go to the same place for their services. Once they found a place they liked, they don't switch unless they moved to another city. The main reason they keep returning is because they can develop a rapport with a stylist, so when they return the stylists already knows the history of the hair and how they normally like it cut. Additionally, other than the one participant that books online, everyone did not ever use their hair salon's website, except for maybe once before their first visit. With this info, it is clear that the majority of users accessing the site will be new potential customers. So it is crucial that the website can provide them with all the information they need to get them to book an appointment."

By moving everything to the homepage, user's can easily navigate the site by scrolling instead of clicking back and forth between pages. From the user interviews, it was important that there was information about the services on the page. I chose to have that info hidden under a More Info so that the info wouldn't crowd the page, but users would still have access to it. For selecting time and date, participants from the user interviews mentioned frustration about having a lot of back and forth in order to find an available time.

Upon clicking the watch party icon, it will bring you to the next screen where you have some options you can set for the watch party. After creating the watch party, you will be prompted with a URL to share with your friends. With a URL, it will be extremely easy for a user to join a watch party as all they have to do is access the URL and they will automatically be placed into the watch party. I chose to keep the chat small and off to the side, so that users can keep it open while watching the stream, and it won't take up too much space. Users may also minimize the chat if they find it distracting. Because participants from the user interviews expressed frustration of having to use separate devices or applications for video/audio calling, I integrated those features as part of the watch party experience.",

Users were not able to watch a real stream nor were they able to realistically chat and use audio and video features. Next, I would like to work on building a prototype with all of these capabilities as a way to truly test users' experiences with the actual viewing part of the feature.
